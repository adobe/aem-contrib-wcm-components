# AEM WCM Components - Community Contributions

This repository was created to allow community contributions for AEM WCM Components to be shared and tested, before they would be integrated into the [Core Components](https://github.com/adobe/aem-core-wcm-components/).

This is a good place to submit your ideas and have them reviewed by the community. It's also a good place for quick iterations. Once an idea matures and starts being used, we will consider it for inclusion into the Core Components.
