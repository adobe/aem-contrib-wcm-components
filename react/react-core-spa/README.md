# AEM WCM Components - Community Contributions - React SPA cire proposal

This is a branch of the AEM WCM Components - Community Contributions maintained by Niek Raaijmakers for now.
It serves as proposal to introduce various react wrappers for the spa editor.

These are only for the spa editor since they have a dependency on @adobe/cq-react-editable-components.

Currently supported / exported components:

Accordion (V1)
Breadcrumb (v2) - using react-dom-router
Button (v1) - using react-dom-router
Container (V1)
Carousel (V1)
Tabs (v2)
